# Janart Gallery

This repository contains a static html/js project that can fetch a gallery via the Imgur API, and display its images using the [PhotoSwipe](https://photoswipe.com/) lightbox library.

For those cloning this project, please replace the Imgur client ID (`imgurClientID`) in index.html with [your own unique client ID](https://api.imgur.com/oauth2/addclient).
